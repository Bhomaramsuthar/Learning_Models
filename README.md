Machine Learning: Classification & PreprocessingThis repository contains implementations and experiments covering the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preparation to model evaluation.📁 Core Topics1. Data PreprocessingFeature Scaling: Implementation of StandardScaler to normalize feature distributions ($mean = 0, std = 1$). Essential for distance-based and gradient-based algorithms.Handling Class Imbalance: Utilizing RandomOverSampler (from imblearn) to balance training sets, ensuring the models do not become biased toward the majority class.Data Splitting: Custom workflows for partitioning data into Training, Validation, and Testing sets to ensure model generalizability.2. Models ImplementedThe following classification algorithms are implemented and compared:K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Distance-based classification using $k$-neighbor voting.Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classification based on Bayes' Theorem with feature independence assumptions.Logistic Regression: Linear model for predicting categorical outcomes via the sigmoid function.Support Vector Machines (SVM): Maximum-margin classification using optimal hyperplanes.Neural Networks (NN): Multi-layer perceptron implementations for capturing non-linear relationships.3. Evaluation MetricsModels are evaluated using metrics beyond simple accuracy to account for imbalanced datasets:Precision & RecallF1 Score (Harmonic mean of precision and recall)Confusion Matrix Analysis🛠️ Tools UsedLanguage: PythonData: Pandas, NumPyVisualization: Matplotlib, SeabornMachine Learning: Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for NN)
